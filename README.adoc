Quoters Incorporated is a service used to support other https://spring.io/guides[Spring Guides].

Instead of relying on someone else's REST service to supply us with data for consumption, we run our own,
filled with real life Spring Boot quotes.

The app is very simple, but can also serve as a reference point for building your own Spring MVC app.

Technologies used:

* Spring MVC
* Spring Data JPA
* H2 embedded database

The app is hosted on https://console.run.pivotal.io/[PWS (_p-dubs_)] at https://gturnquist-quoters.cfapps.io.

* https://gturnquist-quoters.cfapps.io/api - see ALL the quotes

* https://gturnquist-quoters.cfapps.io/api/random - see a random quote
